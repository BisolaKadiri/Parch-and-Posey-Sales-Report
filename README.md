 ## DATA PREPARATION
Each table of the dataset was extracted from SQL. Data transformation was done in Power query, though the tables appeared to be clean, however, each column was checked for validity, errors, and emptiness and was cleaned accordingly. The dataset was then loaded into Microsoft Power BI Desktop.



## DATA VISUALIZATION
Data visualization for the dataset was done using Microsoft Power BI to represent the data and to help communicate the insights derived from the analysis.
